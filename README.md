# What is releaf?
Releaf is a 24-hours-project for social good at HackDavis 2018. 
We believe mental health, such as depression, is an underestimated topic overlooked by many people. 
Many of us might not feel comfortable to share how we really feel when we have the struggles. More often, we don't know who we can share with. We believe having a conversation with someone who is willing to listen is one of the imortant steps to begin, and it is easier to talk to someone we don't know. It might sound unintuitive, but talking to a stranger is not as scary as it seems to be.

"Releaf," is an online chat platform for people who feel an urgent to find someone to talk to - Everyone in releaf is anonymous; your chat history will be cleared immediately after you leave the chat room. Unless you share your personal information with the person you chat with.

# Features
We want to create an open space where people can feel comfortable to present their authentic selves. To establish such atmosphere:

### 1. Your chat content will not be recorded. 
We hope to make you feel the true freedom to share what you want to share.

### 2. We do not ask your name and email.
We hope to make you feel better by talking to someone you don't know. We are not interested in your important personal information, unless you want to do so.

### 3. We give you the best match to chat with.
We hope to give you the best chatting experience. Through our algorithm, we want you find someone who has been through the similar experience so that your chatting partner can relate how you feel.

### 3. A chat experience with the calm music.
Some music can stablize our emotions and ease our nerves. We encourage you to turn on the volume to listen to the music we offer to you during your chat.

### 4. The filter for bad words.
We hope to create a safe and respectful environment. We aim to minimize the nagativities in releaf. Any bad words will be muted during the chat.
